The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is a type of Reinforcement Learning (RL) method that aims to address the challenges of policy gradient methods, such as high variance, long horizon, and continuous spaces. PPO is designed to strike a balance between sample complexity, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation.

In the provided code, the PPOAgent class implements a version of the PPO algorithm called PPO-clip. The main components of the PPO-clip algorithm are:

Policy Network: The policy network is a neural network that takes the current state as input and outputs a probability distribution over possible actions. In this case, the policy network is a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers.

Get Action Probability: This function calculates the probability of taking a specific action given the current state, using the policy network.

Training: The training function updates the policy network's parameters based on the collected experiences. The PPO-clip algorithm uses a surrogate objective function to update the policy network, which is designed to minimize the difference between the new and old policies.

The surrogate objective function is defined as follows:

L(θ) = E_t [ min(r_t(θ) A_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε) A_t) ]

where:

θ are the policy network parameters
t is the time step
r_t(θ) = π_θ(a_t|s_t) / π_θ_old(a_t|s_t) is the probability ratio of the new and old policies
A_t is the advantage function at time step t
ε is the clip ratio, a hyperparameter that controls the update step size
The objective function has two terms:

The first term, r_t(θ) A_t, encourages taking actions with higher advantage values
The second term, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε) A_t, penalizes large policy updates by clipping the probability ratio within the interval [1-ε, 1+ε]
The expectation is taken over the trajectories collected from the environment.

The training process involves the following steps:

Collect a set of trajectories using the current policy
Calculate the advantages for each state-action pair in the trajectories
Update the policy network using the surrogate objective function
By using the clipped objective function, PPO-clip avoids large policy updates that might lead to instability during training. This makes PPO-clip more sample-efficient and stable compared to traditional policy gradient methods.
